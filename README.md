  Performance; minimalism.

> [!TIP]
> This WM focuses on performance and minimalism. It is intended to be used by users who are able to debug issues on their own. It is intentionally stripped down.

### Get Started

- Compile polyWM by using the Makefile
- Run `startx` after setting up `.xinitrc` including the executable binary from your TTY.
